<HTML><BODY>This booklet from 1898 is an early plea for birth-control. The name of  Thomas Robert Malthus may now be much forgotten, but in 1798 (a century before this booklet), he anonymously published <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4239">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a></i>, in which he promotes celibacy and a delay in getting married to limit population growth.

<p>This booklet goes further in that it recognizes the evils of celibacy, then continues to give a lot of detail on the struggle to get this type of information out. The actual (and very limited) information on practical means of anti-conception is finally found in the last few pages.

<p>No particular difficulties foreseen. Have fun!
